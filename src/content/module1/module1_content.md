# Module 1: Introduction to AI (Free Access)

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. When most people hear the term AI, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

AI is being developed to help enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset. AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things such as connecting with friends, using an email program, or using a ride-share service.

### Key Concepts in AI

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken.
- **Computer Vision**: A field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

### Types of AI

AI can be categorized in several ways, but one common distinction is between narrow (or weak) AI and general (or strong) AI:

- **Narrow AI**: Designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, driving a car).
- **General AI**: Possesses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.

Currently, all existing AI systems are narrow AI. General AI remains a theoretical concept and a goal for future development.

## The History of AI

The concept of artificial intelligence has been around for centuries, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that the technology began to develop into what we know today.

### Early Beginnings (1940s-1950s)

- **1943**: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts create a computational model for neural networks.
- **1950**: Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence.
- **1956**: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at the Dartmouth Conference, marking the official birth of the field.

### The First AI Winter (1970s-1980s)

After initial enthusiasm and significant funding, progress slowed, and funding decreased, leading to what is known as the "AI Winter."

- **1969-1979**: Funding for AI research decreases after the Lighthill Report suggests AI wouldn't live up to its promises.
- **1980**: AI research revives with expert systems, programs designed to mimic human expertise in specific domains.

### The Rise of Machine Learning (1990s-2000s)

- **1997**: IBM's Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.
- **2005**: DARPA holds its first driverless car competition, the DARPA Grand Challenge.
- **2008**: Google makes breakthroughs in speech recognition and introduces it in the iPhone app.

### The Deep Learning Revolution (2010s-Present)

- **2011**: IBM Watson defeats champions on Jeopardy!
- **2012**: Google's neural network learns to recognize cats in YouTube videos without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- **2014**: DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats a professional Go player, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.
- **2016**: Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeats world champion Lee Sedol in the board game Go.
- **2020**: OpenAI releases GPT-3, a language model with 175 billion parameters capable of generating human-like text.
- **2023**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude demonstrate unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human language.

- **Surveillance**: AI-powered surveillance technologies can enable unprecedented monitoring.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: AI systems can be vulnerable to manipulated inputs designed to cause incorrect outputs.

### Transparency and Explainability

Many advanced AI systems, particularly deep learning models, function as "black boxes":

- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Developing methods to make AI decision-making transparent and interpretable.
- **Right to Explanation**: In some jurisdictions, individuals have a right to explanations of automated decisions that affect them.

### Accountability and Governance

As AI systems make more consequential decisions, questions of accountability arise:

- **Responsibility**: Who is responsible when an AI system causes harm?
- **Regulation**: How should AI development and deployment be regulated?
- **Standards**: What technical and ethical standards should AI systems meet?
