   - Progress tracking across modules and lessons

3. **Payment Verification**
   - Integration with Buy Me A Coffee
   - Manual verification process for payments
   - Automatic access upgrade after verification

### Admin Features

1. **User Management**
   - View all users
   - Edit user details and roles
   - Delete users

2. **Content Management**
   - Create, edit, and delete modules and lessons
   - Control access levels for content

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The MongoDB database includes the following collections:

1. **Users**
   - Authentication details
   - Profile information
   - Progress tracking
   - Role-based access control

2. **Content**
   - Hierarchical structure (modules, lessons)
   - Access level control
   - Metadata and resources

3. **PaymentVerifications**
   - Verification status tracking
   - Evidence storage
   - Admin notes

### API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for:

1. **Authentication**
   - `/api/v1/auth/register`
   - `/api/v1/auth/login`

   - `/api/v1/auth/forgotpassword`
   - `/api/v1/auth/resetpassword/:resettoken`

2. **Content**
   - `/api/v1/content` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/v1/content/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - `/api/v1/content/slug/:slug` (GET)
   - `/api/v1/content/module/:moduleId` (GET)
   - `/api/v1/content/:id/progress` (POST)

3. **Payment Verification**
   - `/api/v1/payments/verify` (POST)
   - `/api/v1/payments/pending` (GET)
   - `/api/v1/payments/approve/:id` (PUT)
   - `/api/v1/payments/reject/:id` (PUT)

4. **Admin**
   - `/api/v1/admin/users` (GET)
   - `/api/v1/admin/users/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
   - `/api/v1/admin/dashboard` (GET)

### Frontend Components

The React frontend includes:

1. **Authentication Components**
   - Login and Registration forms
   - Password reset functionality
   - Protected routes

2. **Content Display**
   - Module and lesson navigation
   - Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
   - Interactive code examples
   - Progress tracking

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - User management interface
   - Content management system
   - Payment verification workflow

4. **Payment Integration**
   - Buy Me A Coffee integration
   - Payment evidence submission
   - Verification status tracking

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment:

1. **Docker Compose**
   - Orchestrates all services (MongoDB, API, Client)
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Volume management for persistence

2. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Serves the React frontend
   - Proxies API requests to the backend
   - Handles routing for the single-page application

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Separate development and production configurations
   - Secure credential management
   - Configurable service URLs

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Bcrypt password hashing
   - JWT with expiration
   - HTTP-only cookies
   - CSRF protection

2. **API Security**
   - Helmet.js for HTTP headers
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Role-based access control

3. **Data Security**
   - MongoDB authentication
   - Sanitized inputs
   - Secure environment variables

## Admin Credentials

For administrative access, use the following credentials:

- **Username**: admin
